# SoftwareValidationAndVerification

This projects are about software testing and were made on a Master's Degree course.
This course focused on unit tests, multi layers testing, mocking and web application testing;

We used [JUnit](https://junit.org/junit5/) to develop all tests.

# Project 1
Are being used several tecniques like the usage of graphs with different criteria and [PIT](https://pitest.org) plugin to validate the code. The target is a trie source code and the goal is evaluate its functions. To see more details read the report on the corresponding folder.
# Project 2
This assignment is an individual one. I used [HTMLUnit](https://htmlunit.sourceforge.io), [Mockito](https://site.mockito.org) and [DBSetup](http://dbsetup.ninja-squad.com). These are tools than we can use to make multi-layer testing and mock some parts of the code that are not developed at a moment. To see more details read the report in teh corresponding folder.
